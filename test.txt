For this project, I developed a website where users can post, edit, and delete their own food ratings. I also added moderation tools, allowing admins to delete any post or ban users. Unfortunately, due to financial constraints, images can’t be saved or shown.
For this project, I created a website that attempted to immitate the NBA login page as close as possible. While being devloped I hadn’t learned JavaScript, so key features from the NBA login page are missing. It was made with HTML and CSS in Visual Studio Code.
For this project, I learned how to utilize the tools in the Godot game engine by following a tutorial for the Base Camp Video Game Development Club. It was developed with assets from Itch.io, and the project can be downloaded on GitHub. It can be played on Godot.
